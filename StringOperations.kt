/*Let us finish this module with some more practice!

Write a program which does the followingDeclare a string variable word
Assign the value "String" to it
And then print to the console the first 3 characters of the string.
Do not include any space or new line.
When you run the code, you will get a compilation error - go ahead and debug the code as well*/
fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    var word = "String"
    print(word[0]) //Print the first 3 characters - their index is 0, 1, 2
    print(word[1])
    print(word[2]) //Round Brackets were used instead of square
